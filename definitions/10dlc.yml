        Create a new brand for your account. Most accounts will be created 
        immediately, and you can move on to qualifying a new campaign for
        the brand. Some brands may require additional vetting. In such cases,
        please move on to the vetting API endpoints before attempting to 
        create a campaign. 

        Please note the `entity_type` field, as that field value will help
        determine which fields are required.
